## My Process

### Built with

- React Native
- Expo
- NativeWind (Tailwind)
- TypeScript
- react-native-safe-area-context

### What I learned

- React Native: Core components
  -  View: similar with html `<div>`
  -  Text: similar with html `<h1>`, `<p>`...etc
  -  Image: use its `source` mostly like `<img src="">`
  -  TouchableOpacity: add touch interactivity (use it like a `<button>` )
  -  FlatList: render a list
  -  ActivityIndicator: use as a loader
- Expo: Installation and Setup for React Native project
  - `_layout`
  - `(root)/(tabs)`
- Expo router: Routing for React Native
  -  Stack
  -  Tab
  -  Redirect
  -  router
- TypeScript
  - declare `interface` in file `/types/type.d.ts`
- Use Tailwind and Swiper with React Native

### Continued development

- Add Search and Book rides interactivity.
